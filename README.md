A webpage that allows the user to play a basic rock paper scissors game against a computer.
The computer picks a random number that represents either rock(1), paper(2), or scissors(3).
The game then pulls the users choice from a series of Radio Buttons. 
With the game logic it finally compares the two choices and determines the winner.
Results of all wins and ties are tracked and displayed for the user.
The user has the ability to reset all wins and ties back to zero.
